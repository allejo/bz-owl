<pre>Where is the old site?
It has been removed.

I used to show some statistics based on the old site. What can I do now?
Ask. There is a high chance your request will be considered in that case.

Feature (insert description here) should be implemented!
If you don't know the creator of this site very well, don't bother to ask.

How are callsign changes handled?
The callsigns are handled both case preserving and case insensitive. When a user logs in, the callsign will be updated. There is a fallback for the case someone else used the callsign before but it has not changed here yet.

I want to delete my account.
There is no possibility to do that. However the visibility of inactive users will be changed during maintenance.

I'm team leader and I can't leave my team.
You must first set up a new team leader before you can leave.</pre>

<p></font><font class=hfaq><center><b>Rating / Ranking<br />
</b></font></center><hr><font class=qfaq><b>Q:</b></font> <font class=qfaqtxt>What is Ranking?<br />
</font><font class=afaq>A:</font> In addition to doing events (tournaments), the idea is to have an all-time ranking of teams. This is basically a list sorted by each team's rating. The rating of each team is calculated based on all official matches in the league. Official matches can be either tournament matches or challenge matches.<br />
</b></font></center><hr><font class=qfaq><b>Q:</b></font> <font class=qfaqtxt>How does rating work?<br />

</font><font class=afaq>A:</font> We are using a simplified ELO rating. ELO is the system used to estimate the strength of chess players. After a match between two teams A and B, both A and B's ratings are adjusted. The winner's rating will increase while the losing team will lose points. The amount by which the ratings will change depends on the difference between the team's ratings: If a very high rated player loses against a low rated newbie, the newbie will gain significantly, and the other player will lose lots of points. If it's the other way around (higher rated player wins), the changes will be much smaller.<br />
Thus, after time, each team's rating should reflect its relative strength quite accurately. Of course, a team's strength - as well as its rating - is not a constant and will possibly vary over time. Expect major fluctuations in the ranking after a major tournament.<br />
</b></font></center><hr><font class=qfaq><b>Q:</b></font> <font class=qfaqtxt>What's the exact formula used?<br />
</font><font class=afaq>A:</font>  Using the old ratings oldA and oldB, the win probability for team A is calculated:<br />
prob=1.0 / (1 + 10 ^ ((oldB-oldA)/400.0));<br />
score= 1 if A wins, 0.5 for draw, 0 if B wins<br />
The change in the ratings is then calculated by:<br />

diff=50*(score-prob);<br />
After that some rounding magic to integer is applied and the new ratings are calculated:<br />
newA=oldA+diff, newB=oldB-diff;<br />
<br />
<p></font><font class=hfaq><center><b>The Matches<br />
</b></font></center><hr><font class=qfaq><b>Q:</b></font> <font class=qfaqtxt>What server will the battles be on? Which settings will be used?<br />
</font><font class=afaq>A:</font> Only official match servers can be used for official GU matches. The list of official servers can be found here http://gu.bzleague.com/index.php?link=home<br />
</b></font></center><hr><font class=qfaq><b>Q:</b></font> <font class=qfaqtxt>Where do we meet before a battle?<br />

</font><font class=afaq>A:</font> The best place is on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel #bzleague or #guleague on the Openprojects Network (server irc.freenode.net). To access IRC, you need an IRC client program. There are several available for the popular operatign systems. For Windows, you might want to try mirc (www.mirc.com). Web-based access is also available via chat.ircnet.org.<br />
</b></font></center><hr><font class=qfaq><b>Q:</b></font> <font class=qfaqtxt>How do you score in a match?<br />
</font><font class=afaq>A:</font> The matches will be CTF style, i.e. Capture The Flag. Each team (red vs. green) has a base and a flag. A team scores +1 by carrying the opposing team's flag onto their own base. The other team will then lose 1 point. BZFlag will also keep an individual score for each player, but this is not important for the matches.<br />
</b></font></center><hr><font class=qfaq><b>Q:</b></font> <font class=qfaqtxt>When does a battle start? When does it end?<br />
</font><font class=afaq>A:</font> Matches have a fixed duration of 30 minutes. The battle starts as soon as both teams are complete. Ideally there should be some kind of referee watching the battle and giving the start signal. After the match is over, the team with the higher score is the winner. If both teams have the same score, it is a draw.<br />
<br />
</b></font></center><hr><font class=qfaq><b>Q:</b></font> <font class=qfaqtxt>Can I watch a battle although I am not participating?<br />

</font><font class=afaq>A:</font> You will be able to join the server as an observer. To do so, simply set your team accordingly before joining. The number of observers must be limited for technical reasons, so only a handful people will be allowed.<br />
<br />
</b></font></center><hr><font class=qfaq><b>Q:</b></font> <font class=qfaqtxt> We started a match 2v2, and someone had to leave, what happens now?<br />
</font><font class=afaq>A:</font>  Preferably, the match will be paused, and a substitute can be found. If not, both teams should agree to either: cancel the match or continue the match at another time. If both teams do not agree to this, then one of two things must happen:<br />
1) If the leading team has lost a player, the match is simply cancelled.<br />
2) If the trailing team lost the player, it is a forfeit, and the score at the time of losing the player is entered. <br />
<br />

</b></font></center><hr><font class=qfaq><b>Q:</b></font> <font class=qfaqtxt> Is a 1 vs 1 match an official match in the gu league?<br />
</font><font class=afaq>A:</font>  No. Each team must have at least 2 players for the match to be official.<BR><BR>
