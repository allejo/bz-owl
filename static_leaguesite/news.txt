Improvements in comparison to webleague:<br>

• should be more secure<br>
• bzmail outbox<br>
• visits log also detects proxies<br>
• admins can leave comments at player profiles<br>
• action buttons should have a more intuitive description<br>
• its look is almost completely controlled by its style sheets<br>
• small output, good for mobile devices<br>
