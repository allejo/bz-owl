<center>

<p> The GU League Admin Team has prepared general guidelines of ban penalties for bad behavior. These are guidelines only, and actual penalties may be longer or shorter, depending on individual circumstances. In all situations, it is up to the Admins whether to ignore conduct, warn, or impose a ban penalty.

<p> <font color=red>Match disturbance, player harassment, language, cheat accusations in public</font color>
 (1 day -7 days)

<p> <font color=red>Using cheats on public servers or in other leagues</font color>
 (6-9 months)

<p> <font color=red>Using cheats in the GU league</font color>  (1 year to life)

<p> If you suspect someone of cheating, or if you or your team is having a problem with someone's behavior, please report it to any of the GU Admins.

<p> We do not want this to become a police state. But, we do want behavior to be consistent with having fun on the servers without disturbances, harassment, or cheating.
